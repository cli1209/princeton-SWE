<p><b>Welcome Letter</b></p>
<p>Hi and welcome to the Princeton Society of Women Engineers website. Princeton 
SWE is a chapter of the larger national Society of Women Engineers organization. 
It is supported financially by the Princeton School of Engineering and Applied 
Sciences and is a recognized student group through the Office of the Dean of 
Undergraduate Students. <br>
<br>
The Princeton SWE chapter has been active for many years and our regular events 
usually draw 50-60 students. We also co-operate with NJSWE to plan meetings and 
speaker events. Each year we hold our annual High School Colloquium which this 
year will be held in November. Please navigate to that section of our website 
for information about this event. We also send members to SWE conferences, both 
the national and regional conferences where students get an opportunity to meet 
and network with other students and professional women engineers. <br>
<br>
As a society we have set goals to guide how we function as a society. These 
goals are outlined below.<br>
Goals:<br>
<br>
SWE 2009-2010<br>
<br>
For Princeton SWE strives to be a community </p>
<ul>
	<li>Where women engineers to find support for their endeavors and advice and 
	answers to their questions.</li>
	<li>Providing social opportunities to enjoy each others company in the 
	common bond of our interest in science and technology.</li>
	<li>That encourages continued dedication to integration of women in 
	engineering.</li>
	<li>That supports perseverance through difficult classes</li>
	<li>Of caring individuals who support each other and the goal of higher 
	education of women in engineering.</li>
	<li>That gives the feeling you are a part of something special. Believe that 
	you are a part of something special.</li>
	<li>Dedicated to increasing visibility and redefining the perception of 
	women engineers on campus<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Community SWE strives to</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spread the word that women can be engineers.</li>
	<li>Encourage young girls to see careers in math, science, and engineering 
	as an option.</li>
	<li>Give girls a better understanding of what it takes to be an engineer, 
	plus the assurance that the might just have what it takes.</li>
	<li>Increase visibility of women in the field of engineering. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to look around our website. Princeton SWE 
members are passionate about engineering and love to share that passion with 
others. If you would like to partner with SWE for an event please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:swe@princeton.edu">swe[at]princeton.edu</a>. We would love to visit your school and talk to young students 
about what it is like to be an engineer. Also if you are a prospective female 
student interested in engineering and are planning a trip to Princeton, let us 
know! We would be happy to answer any questions that you might have. <br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
